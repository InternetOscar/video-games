# internetoscar's CS:GO Config

This is my constantly updated CS:CO autoexec config.

Put the file *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config!

### Launch Options

Enter launch options at `Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Global Offensivw (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...`

### Other Settings
+ Windows Sensitivity: default  
+ Enhance Pointer Precision: No  
+ Mouse DPI: 1750  
+ Mouse Polling Rate: 1000hz  
+ Windows Aero: No - `hl2.exe Properties > Compatibility > Disable visual themes & Disable desktop composition`
+ I play at 1920x1080 I like the feel and the pov but it's purely preference.
+ In-Game Audio Ouput: Headphones
