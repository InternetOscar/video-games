# internetoscar's CS:GO Config

This is my constantly updated CS:S autoexec config.

Put the file *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\*steam username*\counter-strike source\cstrike\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config!

### Launch Options

Enter launch options at `Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Source (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...`

### Other Settings
+ Windows Sensitivity: 6/11  
+ Enhance Pointer Precision: No  
+ Mouse DPI: 450  
+ Mouse Polling Rate: 500hz  
+ Mouse Fix: [MarkC Windows 8 + 7 Mouse Acceleration Fix](http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html)
+ Windows Aero: No - `hl2.exe Properties > Compatibility > Disable visual themes & Disable desktop composition`
+ I play at 1280x960 stretched (no black bars, full-screen scaling) to 1920x1080. I like the feel, pov, and models are slighlty bigger.  Maybe it's because I'm old school but it's purely preference.
+ In-Game Audio Ouput: Headphones
